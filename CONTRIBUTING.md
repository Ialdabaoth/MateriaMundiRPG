# Contributing to E9 and Materia Mundi

E9 is an old-school (B/X-family) fantasy RPG system, and Materia Mundi is its flagship setting. The project ships three things together: books, apps (E9 Companion and E9 Atlas, with a third, Scribe, planned) and modules (adventures and hexcrawls that run in both apps). Heph (GitHub `Ialdabaoth`) owns the game, writes the books and has the final say on canon and prose.

## How work is organised

Every piece of work has one home thread, named by what it is and which version it is in:

| Kind | Home | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A new idea | a Brainstorm | "Brainstorm hex tile style" |
| An agreed strategy | a Develop | "Develop artist onboarding" |
| An app | one home per app, per minor version | "Atlas 0.5.X Development" |
| A module | one home per module, per minor version | "Module: Hansa 0.2.X Development" |

- An idea starts as a Brainstorm. When it turns into work, it moves to a Develop thread or to the app or module it touches, and the Brainstorm closes. It can be reopened for big-picture thinking.
- Each app and each module has exactly one open home at a time. When the version goes from 0.N.X to 0.N+1.0, the old home closes and a new one opens.
- Changes go to the home of the app or module they touch, even when the idea started elsewhere. Leave a link back to where it came from.
- Work that cuts across several apps or modules goes back to a Brainstorm first.

## Apps and modules

- **E9 Companion** (`companion-app/`): the player and referee PWA. Changelog: `companion-app/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **E9 Atlas** (`modules/tools/`): the map builder and viewer, live at https://ialdabaoth.github.io/MateriaMundiRPG/atlas/. Changelog: `modules/tools/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Scribe** (planned): a WYSIWYG module creator.
- **Modules** (`modules/<id>/`): Beyond the Pale: The Isle of Mists, 1422 (`isle-of-mists`), Hansa (`hansa`), and the E9, MM and MM-for-E9 core modules.

The data formats are specified next to the code: `modules/MODULE_FORMAT.md`, `ATLAS_FORMAT.md`, `CREATURES_FORMAT.md`, `ENCOUNTER_FORMAT.md`, `EVENTS_FORMAT.md`, `WORKFLOWS.md`, `BUILDING_A_MODULE.md`, and `companion-app/*_FORMAT.md`. Ideas that aren't agreed yet go in `modules/PROPOSALS.md`, not in the specs.

Every project goes through five phases in order: product design, Companion integration, Atlas integration, print layout (Affinity Publisher), and release and marketing.

## Canon

Rules and setting questions are settled by two sources:

1. The **E9 System Reference Handbook**.
2. The **Materia Mundi Compendium**.

The MM Player's Handbook and the four MM Magic-User Handbooks are canon too, but they should hold nothing that isn't in the Compendium. If you find a difference, report it rather than picking a side.

Everything else (the old Referee's Guide, playtest sheets, older drafts, work-in-progress modules, brainstorm notes) is not canon. Don't cite it. Nothing joins the canon list until Heph approves it.

Link rules to the wiki (https://github.com/Ialdabaoth/MateriaMundiRPG/wiki) where you can, or cite the Compendium by page. The wiki is the source of truth; don't bulk-edit it.

## Prose belongs to Heph

Heph writes the published prose in his modules and books: room and scene descriptions, creature descriptions, boxed text, players' text and site notes.

- Use his text **word for word**. Splitting a passage across rooms or fields is fine; rewording is not.
- If a passage has to change (a rules name, a date, a canon fix), show the before and after and wait for his OK.
- Where he hasn't written anything yet, leave the field empty or mark it `TODO (Heph)`. Don't fill it in.
- **No LLM-generated descriptive prose** in his modules or books.

Data is fine to write: stats, ids, relations, coordinates, rules mechanics, UI labels.

## House style

- No TSR or other trademarked names in titles or copy.
- Random tables use only d20 and d6.
- Local creature names come first, with the MM rules name in brackets the first time per scene.
- Dates use the MM calendar (MM year = AD + 2085).

## Licences and credit

The suite and its modules are **CC0 1.0** (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)). Anything AI-assisted that Bakagaijin Productions releases is always CC0.

- **Your own work** is yours to license, and the terms are agreed when you're invited. Anything that goes into the suite or into a CC0 module becomes CC0.
- **Purely human work** that the suite uses without changing it (for example an artist's finished piece shown as-is) can be agreed case by case.
- **Third-party material** keeps its licence: E9 System Reference Handbook data (CC BY-SA 4.0), SRD 5.2 data (CC BY 4.0), C. Martins hex tiles in `modules/assets/tiles` (CC BY-SA 4.0; edits stay CC BY-SA and are credited "Art by C. Martins, edited by …"), and map data sources.
- Only bring in material you made yourself or that has a licence that allows it. List every outside source under `credits` in the module's `module.json` (shown in the Atlas Credits dialog) with its licence.

## Pull requests

- Work on a branch and open a PR against `main`. Heph reviews and merges.
- **Every merge to `main` restarts the site deploy and cancels the one in flight**, so PRs are merged in batches. Yours may wait for the next batch; that's normal.
- One PR per change, in the home of the app or module it touches. Bump the version and add a changelog line.
- Any edit to the map build tools (`modules/tools/build.py` and friends) redraws every map on the next build, so say so in the PR.
- If your PR touches prose, include the before/after list.
